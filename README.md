# Working-with-Functions

This is how I securely automate my AWS workflow using structured functions: I store credentials in `~/.aws/credentials` (with separate profiles for testing/production) and configurations in `~/.aws/config`. My Bash script's **functions serve specific protective roles** - `check_aws_cli()` verifies tools exist, `check_aws_profile()` uses `-z` to validate profile settings, and `activate_infos_environment()` safely switches contexts via case statements. These modular functions compartmentalize risks: credential checks happen before execution, environment validation prevents cross-account mistakes, and the argument verifier (`check_num_of_args()`) blocks malformed requests. By isolating these safety mechanisms into functions, the system maintains readability while enforcing security (like `chmod 600` file protection) and operational reliability across AWS accounts, proving that small, focused functions create robust automation.
